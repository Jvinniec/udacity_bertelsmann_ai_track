# Lesson 6

Notes are available in the [notes](notes/) folder.

The [scripts](scripts/) folder contains the various jupyter notebooks that were part of this lesson. Specifically, they contain my completed versions:
* [mnist_mlp_exercise](scripts/mnist_mlp_exercise.ipynb): Trying to classify the MNIST data with an MLP (It is slow and non-trivial)
* [conv_visualization](scripts/conv_visualization.ipynb): Visualizing the output from applying a convolution kernel to an image.
* [maxpooling_visualization](scripts/maxpooling_visualization.ipynb): Visualizing maxpooling in an image.
* [Finding_Edges_and_Custom_Kernels](scripts/Finding_Edges_and_Custom_Kernels.ipynb): A demonstration of how convolution kernels are able to pick out features in an image.
* [cifar10_cnn_exercise](scripts/cifar10_cnn_exercise.ipynb): My attempt to generate a CNN to classify the CIFAR10 dataset.
