## Welcome!
This repository contains my notes, scripts, and projects from the **Bertelsmann AI Track** challenge (phase 1).

## A note about the lessons:
Each lesson in this course is not created equal. Some of the lessons are simple introductions to the material and only last ~10-30 minutes. These lessons I generally didn't take notes on. Other lessons cover complex topics and may take several hours to complete. These lessons I took extensive notes on.

## A note about images in notebooks
I run the notebooks on my personal machine within Visual Studio Code (VSCode). There is currently a bug that prevents images from properly displaying in jupyter notebooks in VSCode. I'll try to rerun the notebooks in the future when the bug is resolved.
